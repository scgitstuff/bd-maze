## Ideas for Extending the Project

- Add other solving algorithms, like breadth-first search or A\*
- Make the visuals prettier, change the colors, etc
- Mess with the animation settings to make it faster/slower. Maybe make backtracking slow and blazing new paths faster?
- Add configurations in the app itself using Tkinter buttons and inputs to allow users to change maze size, speed, etc
- Make much larger mazes to solve
- Make it a game where the user chooses directions
- If you made it a game, allow the user to race an algorithm
- Make it 3 dimensional
- Time the various algorithms and see which ones are the fastest
